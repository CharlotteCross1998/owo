# Requirements

### C
A compiler (my makefile uses gcc)

### C++
A compiler (my makefile uses g++)

### Assembly
nasm

64 bit computer 

### Rust
A compiler (my makefile uses rustc)

### Language independant

ability to sudo if you want to install it

# Installation

* Download the code
* Run "make install"

If you'd rather just compile the binary run

    make

# Notes
I'm not the best programmer, I don't even use c or assembly, but this is so simple anyone could do it.

It doesn't do any fancy checks to see where it can install, it just installs to /usr/bin.

It doesn't have fancy colours, command line arguments, it just prints some simple text. Please don't hurt me.

I'm not even trying to make this work in a million different languages but I get bored and it's a simple project so why not.

I develop on Linux so if it doesn't work in Windows or Mac (which the installation won't) then that's your problem not mine.
I'm not smart enough to do OS checking at install. 

I've never programmed in rust before. I just looked up how to print to the screen and guessed the rest and it worked. I don't know if there's conventions or not. Please don't hurt me for bad code :(
