# Requirements

gcc

ability to sudo if you want to install it

# Installation

* Download the code
* Run "make install"

If you'd rather just compile the binary run

    make

# Notes
I'm not the best programmer, I don't even use c, but this is so simple anyone could do it.

It doesn't do any fancy checks to see where it can install, it just installs to /usr/bin.

It doesn't have fancy colours, command line arguments, it just prints some simple text. Please don't hurt me.
